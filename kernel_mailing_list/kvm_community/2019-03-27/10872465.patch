Subject: [PATCHv1 0/7] vfio/mdev: Improve vfio/mdev core module
Date: Tue, 26 Mar 2019 22:45:38 -0500

As we would like to use mdev subsystem for wider use case as
discussed in [1], [2] apart from an offline discussion.
This use case is also discussed with wider forum in [4] in track
'Lightweight NIC HW functions for container offload use cases'.

This series is prep-work and improves vfio/mdev module in following ways.

Patch-1 Fixes releasing parent dev reference during error unwinding
mdev parent registration.
Patch-2 Simplifies mdev device for unused kref.
Patch-3 Drops redundant extern prefix of exported symbols.
Patch-4 Returns right error code from vendor driver.
Patch-5 Fixes to use right sysfs remove sequence.
Patch-6 Fixes removing all child devices if one of them fails.
Patch-7 Fixes conditions with mdev device life cycle APIs

This series is tested using
(a) mtty with VM using vfio_mdev driver for positive tests.
(b) mtty with vfio_mdev with error race condition cases of create,
remove and unloading of mtty driver.
(c) mlx5 core driver using RFC patches [3] and internal patches.
Internal patches are large and cannot be combined with this
prep-work patches. It will posted once prep-work completes.

Subject: [PATCH 0/2] KVM: x86: Fix SMM bugs for 32-bit guests/hosts
Date: Tue,  2 Apr 2019 08:10:46 -0700
Message-Id: <20190402151048.29835-1-sean.j.christopherson@intel.com>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 2.21.0
MIME-Version: 1.0

Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <kvm.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: kvm@vger.kernel.org
X-Virus-Scanned: ClamAV using ClamSMTP

Fix two tangentially related bugs that manifest when the guest's long
mode capabilities diverges from the host kernel's support, i.e. a 32-bit
vCPU running under 64-bit KVM, or a (not-actually-supported) 64-bit vCPU
running under 32-bit KVM.

Sean Christopherson (2):
  KVM: x86: Don't clear EFER during SMM transitions for 32-bit vCPU
  KVM: x86: Always use 32-bit SMRAM save state for 32-bit kernels

Subject: [PATCH 0/2] KVM: x86: Enforce EFER bits according to CPUID
Date: Tue,  2 Apr 2019 08:19:14 -0700

KVM currently doesn't prevent the guest from setting EFER bits that
should be reserved based on the guest's CPUID model.  For example, a
64-bit guest kernel can set EFER.LME and enter long mode even if userspace
reports X86_FEATURE_LM=0 for its guest.

Sean Christopherson (2):
  KVM: x86: Skip EFER vs. guest CPUID checks for host-initiated writes
  KVM: x86: Inject #GP if guest attempts to set unsupported EFER bits

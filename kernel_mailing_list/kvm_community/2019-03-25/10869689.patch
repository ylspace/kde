Hi,

so AFAIR this got applied before the merge window but it is not
upstream. Very strange.

So let me send it again, might get more lucky this time. Rebased ontop
of 5.1-rc1.

Please apply,
thanks.

Changelog:
==========

v3:

here's a rediff ontop of -rc2. No changes, only added Yazen's Tested-by.

v2:

here's v2, dropping patch 3 and incorporating hopefully all of Radim's
feedback.

v1:

there's this mce-inject.ko module in the kernel which allows for
injecting real MCEs and thus test the MCE handling code.

It is doubly useful to be able to inject same MCEs in a guest so that
testing of the MCE handling code can happen even easier/faster. In order
to be able to do that on an AMD guest, we need to emulate some bits
and pieces like the HWCR[McStatusWrEn] bit which allows writes to the
MCi_STATUS registers without a #GP.

The below does that and with it I'm able to properly inject MCEs in said
guest.

Subject: [PATCH v7 00/23] SMMUv3 Nested Stage Setup

This series allows a virtualizer to program the nested stage mode.
This is useful when both the host and the guest are exposed with
an SMMUv3 and a PCI device is assigned to the guest using VFIO.

In this mode, the physical IOMMU must be programmed to translate
the two stages: the one set up by the guest (IOVA -> GPA) and the
one set up by the host VFIO driver as part of the assignment process
(GPA -> HPA).

On Intel, this is traditionnaly achieved by combining the 2 stages
into a single physical stage. However this relies on the capability
to trap on each guest translation structure update. This is possible
by using the VTD Caching Mode. Unfortunately the ARM SMMUv3 does
not offer a similar mechanism.

However, the ARM SMMUv3 architecture supports 2 physical stages! Those
were devised exactly with that use case in mind. Assuming the HW
implements both stages (optional), the guest now can use stage 1
while the host uses stage 2.

This assumes the virtualizer has means to propagate guest settings
to the host SMMUv3 driver. This series brings this VFIO/IOMMU
infrastructure.  Those services are:
- bind the guest stage 1 configuration to the stream table entry
- propagate guest TLB invalidations
- bind MSI IOVAs
- propagate faults collected at physical level up to the virtualizer

This series largely reuses the user API and infrastructure originally
devised for SVA/SVM and patches submitted by Jacob, Yi Liu, Tianyu in
[1-2] and Jean-Philippe [3-4].

Best Regards

Eric

History:
v6 -> v7:
- removed device handle from bind/unbind_guest_msi
- added "iommu/smmuv3: Nested mode single MSI doorbell per domain
  enforcement"
- added few uapi comments as suggested by Jean, Jacop and Alex

v5 -> v6:
- Fix compilation issue when CONFIG_IOMMU_API is unset

v4 -> v5:
- fix bug reported by Vincent: fault handler unregistration now happens in
  vfio_pci_release
- IOMMU_FAULT_PERM_* moved outside of struct definition + small
  uapi changes suggested by Kean-Philippe (except fetch_addr)
- iommu: introduce device fault report API: removed the PRI part.
- see individual logs for more details
- reset the ste abort flag on detach

v3 -> v4:
- took into account Alex, jean-Philippe and Robin's comments on v3
- rework of the smmuv3 driver integration
- add tear down ops for msi binding and PASID table binding
- fix S1 fault propagation
- put fault reporting patches at the beginning of the series following
  Jean-Philippe's request
- update of the cache invalidate and fault API uapis
- VFIO fault reporting rework with 2 separate regions and one mmappable
  segment for the fault queue
- moved to PATCH

v2 -> v3:
- When registering the S1 MSI binding we now store the device handle. This
  addresses Robin's comment about discimination of devices beonging to
  different S1 groups and using different physical MSI doorbells.
- Change the fault reporting API: use VFIO_PCI_DMA_FAULT_IRQ_INDEX to
  set the eventfd and expose the faults through an mmappable fault region

v1 -> v2:
- Added the fault reporting capability
- asid properly passed on invalidation (fix assignment of multiple
  devices)
- see individual change logs for more info
